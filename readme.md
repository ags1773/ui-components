Sample UI library exporting styled react components.
Sandbox for learning how to export libraries using webpack

#### Note:

if you're getting warning `react not defined`, install it `npm i react react-dom --no-save`
react is a peer dependancy. It's needed for development but npm doesn't install it on running `npm i`

## Import components:

```js
import { Basket, Image } from "ui-components";
```
